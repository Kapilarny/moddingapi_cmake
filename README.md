# ModdingAPI plugin template for CMake

Cause VS fucking sucks >:)

# Building

- Clone the repo (with submodules) `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/Kapilarny/moddingapi_cmake`
- Set your output dir in `CMakeLists.txt`
- Compile with CMake using MSVC compiler and enjoy! (other compilers might work but would need to change the `CMakeLists.txt` file to support that)
